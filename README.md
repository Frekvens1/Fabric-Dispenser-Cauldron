# Fabric Dispenser Cauldron

## Usage

Install it in your mods folder. Works both for singelplayer and for a server. The clients don't need the mod for it to work on a server.

This mod adds the functionality to let dispensers use both buckets and bottles on cauldrons (You can also fill it). This is a feature I've been missing for a while, and was very surprised none had made this for 1.17.1 yet, so here I am. Enjoy!
