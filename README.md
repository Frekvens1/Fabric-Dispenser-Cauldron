# Fabric Dispenser Cauldron

## Usage
This is a Fabric mod for 1.17.1


Works both for singelplayer and for servers. The clients don't need this mod when playing on a server.


This mod lets dispensers use both buckets and bottles with cauldrons (Fill and empty it). This is a feature I've been missing for a while and was very surprised none had made this for 1.17.1 yet (Which I was aware of), so here I am. If you find any bugs, please comment below!

 
Enjoy! :)
