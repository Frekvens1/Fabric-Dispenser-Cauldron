# Fabric Dispenser Cauldron

## Usage
### This is a Fabric mod for 1.17.1


Works for both singelplayer and servers. Clients don't need this mod when playing on a server.

Now you can finally fully automate that dripstone lava farm! :)

This mod lets dispensers use both buckets and bottles with cauldrons (Fill and empty it). This is a feature I've been missing for a while and was very surprised none had made this for 1.17.1 yet (Which I was aware of), so here I am.

 
Enjoy! :)
